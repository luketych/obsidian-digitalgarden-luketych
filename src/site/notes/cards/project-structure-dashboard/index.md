**Project Structure Dashboard**



obsidian://open?vault=obsidian-digital-garden&file=cards%2Fproject-structure-dashboard%2Findex



I want to be able to see my project in different views:

  - The basic absolute view, which is based on the directories and files.
  - All of the APIs: I want to be able to see a list of all of the folders (and optionally, files) for the apis, for nodejs, and python in the future.
  - Everything that is involved in the full-circle process (from creating an order procedure, to a srtOrder, to interactive brokers, and back). This should be obviously clear.
  - Everything python.
  - Everything nodejs backend.
  - Everything front-end. Ie, dashboards.
  - Everything experimental (lvl♾️) versus everything currently stable, versus everything currently fundamental (but being worked on.)


I should be able to filter out and filter for certain file types, ie filter out config files, .env files, etc. This will make it more clear to see only the fundamental folders & files, which will help me to see the big-picture of how everything fits together.
