<u>**@Brendan** intro to accountant:</u> 
Make it very brief intro & not a money grab. 

Talk to accountant @Brendan is recommending & also my @Dad's accountant. 

Talking to my Dad's accountant will offer us the opportunity to do good cop - bad cop with her. 
  - For example, if she likes me then she will treat me Dad better. But I also want to have the opinion of the accountant than @Brendan knows since he might be more familiar with this stuff.
