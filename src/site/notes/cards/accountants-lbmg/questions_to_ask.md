=> Start keeping a list of questions to ask the accountant. This is something I can store in my digital garden and reference on a card. 
    Some example questions to get started:
      - What are my options for minimizing tax? 
        Here are some of my ideas: 
          - incorporate in another country.
      - Am I able to qualify any of the money coming in as capital gains? What if I were to invest in the company for over a year and was not active during that time? Even though I was listed as CTO? Or is it better to pay ourselves out as a salary?
      - What if I am an employee of my own company? Is that a way to save on taxes? I see that self-employed income is taxed higher than employment income.
      - What if I had 2 corporations. CorpA sends $10k to CorpB. Then CorpB pays me as a salary. Will this save any money on taxes?
          - What if CorpA loads $10,000 to CorpB and CorpB invests this money and loses it? Ie in stocks? Ie investing in another company? ie via business expenses: laptops, office space, etc.
      - What if I started an investment company in a country where it was easier than Canada?
        - Then what I would do is use Interactive Brokers custom indexing to invest in stocks, which would then allow me to apply my gains as capital gains rather than active trading. Would this work?

    ChatGPT Questions:
        - "Should I explore strategies like transfer pricing for moving money or assets between my Canadian and Delaware companies? What would be the best way to do this without triggering tax complications?"
        - "Given that I live in BC, Canada, what should I consider regarding my tax residency status if I travel frequently or spend a significant amount of time outside Canada? Can I reduce my tax liability through residency planning?"
        - "Could I benefit from setting up a holding company in another country that has favorable tax laws, while still managing my assets in Canada and Delaware?"
        - "What steps should I take to protect the assets ($300k) in the Delaware company, both from a tax and legal liability standpoint? Would setting up trusts or similar structures help reduce risk?"
        - "If I engage in custom indexing through Interactive Brokers, what steps should I take to ensure that my gains are taxed as capital gains instead of business income? Would the CRA scrutinize this if I am actively involved in trading decisions?"
        - "What are the benefits and drawbacks of starting an investment company in another country, like Cyprus or Malta, which has more favorable tax regulations? How would this interact with my Canadian tax obligations?"
	- "Could I defer Canadian taxes by leaving investment income in a foreign company and only withdrawing it as dividends later?"
        - "If one of my companies (e.g., CorpB) takes a loss on an investment (e.g., in stocks or another company), how can I deduct this loss? Can the loss be carried forward or used to offset income in other years?"
	- "What are the rules for deducting business expenses in Canada vs. the U.S. when it comes to things like office space, equipment, or other capital investments?"
        - "If I set up an investment fund in a low-tax country and manage assets through Interactive Brokers, could this allow me to take advantage of global tax treaties or lower tax rates on capital gains?"
        - "How would custom indexing be treated differently in terms of taxes if I manage it from a non-Canadian company versus from a Canadian-based company?"
	- "How can I structure my companies and personal investments to minimize capital gains tax upon selling my company shares or exiting the business? Are there specific exit strategies I should plan for?"
        - "What are the advantages of using RRSPs or TFSAs to shield certain investments from tax, even if I am investing heavily through my corporations?"
