We cannot see past uncertainty.

The further into the future we look the more unknowns that need to be visualized.

"How old will I be when I'm rich?" "When I have a house?" "A family?"
"Where will I live?" (This one is very powerful because the location part of our brain, especially in men?, is important and central to a lot of our thinking, which is why I think I feel so fatigued whenever my stuff is scattered.)

All of these questions create tension in the mind that seeks resolution.

In politics maybe the social forces give us an way to resolve that tension. You don't need to deal with it alone. You can join a team, and let the team do the thinkin'.
