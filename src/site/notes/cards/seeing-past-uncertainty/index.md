We cannot see past uncertainty.

The further into the future we look the more unknowns that need to be visualized.

"How old will I be when I'm rich?" "When I have a house?" "A family?"
"Where will I live?" (This one is very powerful because the location part of our brain, especially in men?, is important and central to a lot of our thinking, which is why I think I feel so fatigued whenever my stuff is scattered.)

All of these questions create tension in the mind that seeks resolution.

In politics maybe the social forces give us an way to resolve that tension. You don't need to deal with it alone. You can join a team, and let the team do the thinkin'.



It is very difficult to hold more than 2 ideas in our heads simultaneously.

So the further we look into the future, the more and more difficult it becomes. The more tension we feel. We seek to resolve it by narrowing our focus. For some of us, having one pathway is enough. For many of us, we realize that the future is uncertain and not that simple. We can't believe there is only a single future. That makes no sense. It makes things feel deterministic, set in stone. That hurts some of us. So maybe we compensate by imagining more than 1 scenario.

So there are psychological forces that want us to increase the number, and other psychological forces that wants to decrease the number. Two is usually good enough, because we have a strong desire to have more than 1, and the further we look out the harder and harder it becomes. 

There is a strong diminished increase in value when moving from 2 options to 3. It is often not worth it. But to preserve at least 2 is crucial for many of us, especially if we have a strong emotional aversion to being forced down a single track, or determined path.
